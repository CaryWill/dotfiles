## Vim9

Since the neovim API is not stable, I quit using neovim, so this is the configuaration of Original Vim with the version 9

## Liked fonts

1. Monolisa(13, 100, 135)
2. Menlo(13, 100, 110)
3. JetBrainsMono
4. version 9.0.1833 works

Note: all fonts are nerd-font patched.

## TODO

- [ ] Vim git previous commit up down in fzf
- [ ] tmux copy vi mode not work in terminal.app
