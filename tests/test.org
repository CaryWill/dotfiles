* This is the title

  About this one, i would like to start writing the article in org mode,
  but there's some thing that is missing, like image inline preview, i need get it work first.

** So here goes the todos
   But actually i dont know how people using vim/neovim as the editor to write stuff,
   no matter it's in markdown or other format.
*** TODO orgmode image [2/6]
    - [X] orgmode inline image preview
        i can use markdown as an example to test, now i can use it, but, there's
        bug
    - [ ] there's an empty when rendering(md file works great, but orgmode is not right)
    - [X] image still shows when switch tmux window(using, <prefix-prefix>)
          tmux_show_only_in_active_window = true, when setup 3rd/image plugin
    - [ ] image should have a textchange option, it will not update instantly when i change
      text right now, but i can use clear in insert mode to work around
    - [ ] read 3rd/image.nvim source code
    - [ ] local image rendering, sometimes i need image rendering
*** TODO neovim related [1/1]
    - [X] same test command for different filetype
** UI for terminal tabs
   It looks good.

* Learning orgmode
** TODO orgmode real life usage
   [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Deadlines-and-Scheduling.html][orgmode official website]]
